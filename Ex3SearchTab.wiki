#summary This is the Example 3 using the Search Tab

= Search all human proteins which are linked to all elements on the Ontology list using the Search Tab =

The first step is to obtain the Human Taxonomy Object as in the [Ex1SearchTab Example 1]. After this, the ontology list should be saved as in the [Ex2SearchTab Example 2].

Then, right click on the first Ontology and click on the *Add to New Constrain* option.

A new [ConstrainsTab Constrain Tab] will be created with the ontology added. Then, do the same procedure with the second ontology but clicking on the *Add selected on Constrain --> Constrain #*.

At this point, the *External Operation* on the Constrain table is changed to the *OR* operator and saved it to the *Result Tab*.

Now, create a new *Search Tab* with the *Protein* !DataSet clicking on the *Add to New Search* option on the right click popup over the Taxonomy object. Then, add the Constrain to the created *Search Tab*.
