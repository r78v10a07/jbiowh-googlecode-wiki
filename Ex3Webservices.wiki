#summary This is the Example 3 using the JBioWH Webservices

= Identify all human proteins which are linked to all elements on the Ontology list using the JBioWH Webservices =

Here we are searching for human proteins who are related to all of the Ontology groups: {{{GO:0002480,GO:0060337}}}  


The Java Code for this example is [http://jbiowh.googlecode.com/svn/jbiowh-tools/src/main/java/org/jbiowhtools/examples/FindALLHumProtinGOwithConstUsingWebServices.java here]

Go to a CMD Windows console or a linux console to execute the java code:

<code language="bash">
java -cp <path-to the-jbiowhtool-jar-file> org.jbiowhtools.examples.FindALLHumProtinGOwithConstUsingWebServices -v
</code>

The obtained result is the same that in the others methods.
