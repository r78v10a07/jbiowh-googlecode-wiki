#summary This wiki describe the Taxonomy dataset

= Taxonomy =

The *Taxonomy* dataset is based on the [http://ncbiwebsite NCBI Taxonomy] data source. The figure shows the Taxonomy dataset relational schema.

The *Taxonomy* table is the principal table for this dataset. This table includes, in the field *DataSet_WID*, the dataset *WID* in the *DataSet* table as a foreign key. Also, this table includes the *TaxId* field that is used as link between other data sources and the *NCBI Taxonomy* data source. The hierarchical nature of the *NCBI Taxonomy* data source is represented by the *ParentTaxId* field where the Taxonomy’s parent *TaxId* is storage.  The *WID* field is not used to represent this hierarchical nature because the original data source uses the *TaxId* field which is an integer value that can be used as key at the same time that the *WID* field.

There are some other three tables, *TaxonomyDivision*, *TaxonmyGenCode* and *TaxonomySynonymNameClass* which are used to organize the information to describe the taxonomies inserted the dataset. The *TaxonomyDivision* includes the *Division* information of the *NCBI Taxonomy* data source.  The *TaxonmyGenCode* includes the *GenCode* information of the *NCBI Taxonomy* data source.  Both tables are referenced as foreign key into the *Taxonomy* table in the fields *TaxonomyDivision_WID*, *TaxonmyGenCode_WID*, *TaxonmyMCGenCode_WID* respectively. The *TaxonomySynonymNameClass* includes the different synonym types into the *NCBI Taxonomy* data source. This synonym types are useful to differentiate the multiples Taxonomy’s names.
 
The *TaxonomyPMID* table includes the available Taxonomy’s *PMID*. These *PMID* are parsed form the *citations.dmp* file of the *NCBI Taxonomy* data source. The citations which not provide the *PMID* are storage into the *TaxonomyUnParseCitation*. This includes web sites, images web address, books, etc. These unparsed citations are related with the *Taxonomy* through the many-to-many relationship table *Taxonomy_has_ TaxonomyUnParseCitation*.
The rest of disconnected tables (*DivisionTemp*, *CitTax*, *GenCodeTemp*, *Names*, *Nodes* and *NCBCitationTemp*) are temporal tables which are used by the insertion and parser application. After the insertion and parse process these tables remains empty. 
 
The nest figure shows the Taxonomy search windows on the Desktop tool.

This tool will include the ability to search by *TaxId* and *Synonym* (human, H.sapiens, Homo%) including the use of simple regular expressions too. The search windows will produce a new window, nest figure, with a list of the found taxonomies given the possibility of mouse click on the taxonomy to view its complete description. Also, this window gives the possibility to save in a TSV file format the selected taxonomies or pass it to the result interface for further uses.

The taxonomy complete description window

This window gives access to a graphical representation of the hierarchical view of this taxonomy showing its parents in a tree like way. This tree, shows in the next figure, gives access to the taxonomy complete description window of each branch in this tree.
