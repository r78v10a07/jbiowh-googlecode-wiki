= Disease =

The *Disease* module is based on the [http://www.omim.org/ OMIM] data source. The next figure shows the relational schema for the *OMIM* dataset. The non-connected tables are temporal tables which are used during the insertion process and remain empties after that.

The *OMIM* table is the main tale on this module. The primary key on this table is the *WID* and it includes, in the field *!DataSet_WID*, the dataset *WID* in the *!DataSet* table as a foreign key. The *OMIM id* is storage on the *OMIM_ID* field on this table. The rest of the tables included on this module storage all data provide by *OMIM*.

The relationship between the omim objects are build it on using the *WID* identifier in order to have a common integer identifier more easily to use and more efficient to index by the *DBMS* engine. 

The relationship with the Gene dataset is storage on the *{{{GeneInfo_has_OMIM}}}* table. This table is constructed using the *Gene2MIM* table included on the Gene module. The *{{{GeneInfo_has_OMIM}}}* table is recreated after an update of the Gene dataset or the OMIM dataset.  This table uses as geneinfo's primary key the *WID* field on the !GeneInfo table and the omim's primary key the *WID* field on the OMIM table.
