The text field on the *!ComboBox* side gives a quick search on the principal parameters of the selected dataset. The *Other parameters* table gives the option to choose other fields to perform the query. In this table the columns shows the query parameters that have to be specified to perform the query. The first column: *External Op* specified the logical operation between parameters. If only one parameter is added this field remain empty. The *Field* column specified the dataset field to be used to perform the query. This parameter depends of the selected main dataset to be queried.

The *External Operation* specified the link logical operation between constrains.
