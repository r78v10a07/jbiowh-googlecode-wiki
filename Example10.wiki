= Question =

Given a drug identify a) target neighbors, if they act on the same protein b) pathway neighbors if they act on proteins that belong to the same metabolic pathway or c) distant neighbors, if they act on different pathways and they are antibiotics. This graph has drugs and pathways as vertices and protein as edges.

The Java Code for this example is [https://jbiowh.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/main/java/org/jbiowh/tools/examples/DrugProteinPathwayGraph.java here]

Go to a CMD Windows console or a linux console to execute the java code: 

<code language="bash">
java -cp <path-to the-jbiowh-jar-file> org.jbiowh.tools.examples.DrugPathwayGraph -d 4 --drug1 DB00739 --pattern antibiotic
</code>

The JBioWH framework includes the [DrugPathwayGraph DrugPathwayGraph] which build a graph from JBioWH main entity. 

We take the drug Hetacillin ([http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00739 DB00739]) as an example. Hetacillin is a beta-lactam that does not have intrinsic antibacterial activity, but is converted by the body to ampicillin, which is active against a variety of organisms. This drug is reported to acts on proteins Penicillin-binding protein 1A ([http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q8DR59 PBPA_STRR6]) and Penicillin-binding protein 2B ([http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P0A3M6 PBP2_STRR6]) of Streptococcus pneumoniae R6 ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Info&id=171101&lvl=3&lin=f&keep=1&srchmode=1&unlock 171101]). Unfortunately, this drug is not related to other proteins, according with the information provided by the biological databases, and, therefore, to other organisms. Additionally, the aforementioned proteins are parts of the Peptidoglycan biosynthesis ([http://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?pathway+spr00550 spr00550]) of the Streptococcus pneumoniae !R6 ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Info&id=171101&lvl=3&lin=f&keep=1&srchmode=1&unlock 171101]). 

The answer provided by JBioWH is that a) the drug has 19 target neighbors would act on the same protein target, b) has 38 pathway neighbors and c) the drug has 35 nearest distant neighbor which are identified as antibiotics. 

Also, this kind of drug-pathway graph can be usefull to identify antibiotics drugs which acts on diferent organisms. The drugs Ceftazidime ([http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00438 DB00438]) and Cyclacillin ( [http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01000 DB01000]) are antibiotics drugs which acts on Streptococcus pneumoniae R6 ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Info&id=171101&lvl=3&lin=f&keep=1&srchmode=1&unlock 171101]), Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655 ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Info&id=511145&lvl=3&lin=f&keep=1&srchmode=1&unlock 511145]) and Clostridium perfringens str. 13 ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Info&id=195102&lvl=3&lin=f&keep=1&srchmode=1&unlock 195102]). 

The graph contains 2 407 vertexes (Drugs and KEGG pathways) and was created in 135 seconds. 

The total execution time was 325 seconds. 

Also, we developed a simple graphical interface to visualize the paths. The JBioWH framework use the [http://jgrapht.org/ Jgrapht] and [http://www.jgraph.com/ JGraph] java libraries to handled and visualize the graphs.

The Java Code for this graphical example is [https://jbiowh.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/main/java/org/jbiowh/tools/examples/DrugPathwayGraphFrame.java here]

Go to a CMD Windows console or a linux console to execute the java code: 

<code language="bash">
java -cp <path-to the-jbiowh-jar-file> org.jbiowh.tools.examples.DrugPathwayGraphFrame
