= Question =

Given two drugs ([http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00587 DB00587] and [http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB03785 DB03785]) identify the shortest path between them in a graph of drugs, proteins and pathways.

The Java Code for this example is [https://jbiowh.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/main/java/org/jbiowh/tools/examples/DrugPathwayGraph.java here]

Go to a CMD Windows console or a linux console to execute the java code: 

<code language="bash">
java -cp <path-to the-jbiowh-jar-file> org.jbiowh.tools.examples.DrugPathwayGraph -d 10 --drug1 DB00587 --drug2 DB03785
</code>

The JBioWH framework includes the !BioWHGraph which build a graph from JBioWH main entity. 

In this example we started the graph from the drug [http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00587 DB00587] including in the graph the !DrugBank, Protein and KEGGPathway entities. 

The graph contains 4 610 vertexes (Drugs, Proteins and KEGG pathways) and was created in 28 seconds. 

Then, the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm Dijkstra's algorithm] was used to find the shortest path between the initial drug [http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00587 DB00587] and the second  drug [http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00587 DB00587] in 0 seconds.

The found path contains 9 vertexes and 8 edges:

{{{
DB00587 <--> CLTR1_HUMAN <--> hsa04020 <--> KCC2A_HUMAN <--> DB04447 <--> HMDH_HUMAN <--> DB01992 <--> MVAA_PSEMV <--> DB03785
}}}

The total execution time was 29 seconds. 

Also, we developed a simple graphical interface to visualize this path. The JBioWH framework use the [http://jgrapht.org/ Jgrapht] and [http://www.jgraph.com/ JGraph] java libraries to handled and visualize the graphs.

The Java Code for this graphical example is [https://jbiowh.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/main/java/org/jbiowh/tools/examples/DrugPathwayGraphFrame.java here]

Go to a CMD Windows console or a linux console to execute the java code: 

<code language="bash">
java -cp <path-to the-jbiowh-jar-file> org.jbiowh.tools.examples.DrugPathwayGraphFrame
