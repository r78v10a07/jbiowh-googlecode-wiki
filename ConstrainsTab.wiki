The *Constrains Tab* is the GUI to setup several conditions in a single constrain to be used in the query. The Constrains list can be saved on the *Result Tab* for other uses.

This approach is useful if the query includes several logical *AND* or *OR* operators. For example, a query to return all human and rat proteins which belongs to an ontology list should uses a Constrain which includes the two Taxonomies objects linked with a *AND* operator to the ontology list. 

The *Constrains* table shows the inserted biological objects list by its object types. On this table *Right Click* on a selected constrain gives the available operation over this constrain.

The first table column shows the Constrain type. It could be *Single* type which refers to a single object, *Multiple* type which refers to an object list or *Constrain* type which refers to another constrain. The *Operation* column gives the possibility to choose the operation to be used.

The last column, *External Operation* specified the logical operation between the inserted constrains.
