#summary The DrugPathwayGraph class

The !DrugPathwayGraph class creates an undirected and weighted graph of drugs-pathways. This graph uses the proteins as edges creating the relationship between drugs and pathways.  The edges are weighted depending on how many times each relationship (drug-pathway) is created by different proteins.

This class extends the [JBioWHGraph JBioWHGraph] class and override the [http://jbiowh.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/javadoc/jbiowh-persistence/org/jbiowhpersistence/utils/graph/JBioWHGraph.html#populate(org.jbiowhpersistence.datasets.drug.drugbank.jpa.entities.DrugBank,%20int) populate(DrugBank o, int varDepth)] method for the !DrugBank entity and the [http://jbiowh.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/javadoc/jbiowh-persistence/org/jbiowhpersistence/utils/graph/JBioWHGraph.html#populate(org.jbiowhpersistence.datasets.pathway.kegg.jpa.entities.pathway.KEGGPathway,%20int) populate(KEGGPathway o, int varDepth)] method for the !KEGGPathway entity. 

The graph created is a [http://jgrapht.org/javadoc/org/jgrapht/graph/ListenableUndirectedWeightedGraph.html ListenableUndirectedWeightedGraph].
