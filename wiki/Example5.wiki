Creates a Taxonomy family graph from a Taxonomy parent. The java API contains a [TaxonomyGraph] class that create a Taxonomy graph starting from a parent Tax id. This graph is useful to preform queries over entire families.

The Java Code for this example is [http://jbiowh.googlecode.com/svn/jbiowh-tools/src/main/java/org/jbiowhtools/taxonomy/FindTaxonomyGraph.java here]

Go to a CMD Windows console or a linux console to execute the java code: 

<code language="bash">
java -cp <path-to the-jbiowhtool-jar-file> org.jbiowhtools.taxonomy.FindTaxonomyGraph -t <Tax Id>
</code>

   * The graph for the [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Info&id=2&lvl=3&lin=f&keep=1&srchmode=1&unlock Bacteria] kingdom (Tax Id: 2) contains 283 371 taxonomy vertexes and 283 370 direct edges between them. The graph was created in 121 seconds. The total execution time was 123 seconds.

<code language="bash">
java -cp <path-to the-jbiowhtool-jar-file> org.jbiowhtools.taxonomy.FindTaxonomyGraph -v -t 2
</code>

   * The graph for the [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?id=1313 Streptococcus pneumoniae] (Tax Id: 1313) contains 303 Taxonomy vertexes and 302 direct edges between them. The graph was created in 2 seconds. The total execution time was 3 seconds.

<code language="bash">
java -cp <path-to the-jbiowhtool-jar-file> org.jbiowhtools.taxonomy.FindTaxonomyGraph -v -t 1313
</code>


   * The graph for the [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Info&id=32008&lvl=3&lin=f&keep=1&srchmode=1&unlock Burkholderia] (Tax Id: 32008) contains 3790 Taxonomy vertexes and 3789 direct edges between them. The graph was created in 4 seconds. The total execution time was 5 seconds.
