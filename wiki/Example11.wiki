Creates a weighted graph with the protein-protein interaction network from a !UniProt accession number.

This example use the [ProteinProteinGraph] class which extends the [JBioWHGraph JBioWHGraph] class. 

The class [ProteinProteinGraph] creates a [http://jgrapht.org/javadoc/org/jgrapht/graph/ListenableUndirectedWeightedGraph.html ListenableUndirectedWeightedGraph] and override the populate method for the Protein entity and uses a method to insert the vertexes and edges.

The Java Code for this example is [http://jbiowh.googlecode.com/svn/jbiowh-tools/src/main/java/org/jbiowhtools/examples/PPIGraph.java here]

Go to a CMD Windows console or a linux console to execute the java code: 

<code language="bash">
java -cp <path-to the-jbiowhtool-jar-file> org.jbiowhtools.examples.PPIGraph -d 4 --acc1 P27049
</code>

The graph contains 119 vertexes and was created in 9 seconds.

Also, we developed a simple graphical interface to visualize this path. The JBioWH framework use the [http://jgrapht.org/ Jgrapht] and [http://www.jgraph.com/ JGraph] java libraries to handled and visualize the graphs.

The Java Code for this graphical example is [http://jbiowh.googlecode.com/svn/jbiowh-tools/src/main/java/org/jbiowhtools/examples/ProteinProteinGraphFrame.java here]

Go to a CMD Windows console or a linux console to execute the java code: 

<code language="bash">
java -cp <path-to the-jbiowhtool-jar-file> org.jbiowhtools.examples.ProteinProteinGraphFrame
</code>
