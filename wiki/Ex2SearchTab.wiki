#summary This is the Example 2 using the Search Tab

= Identify all human proteins which are linked to one of the Ontologies in the Ontology List using the Search Tab =

The first step is to obtain the Human Taxonomy Object as in the [Ex1SearchTab Example 1]. After this, the ontology list should be created by a search over the Ontology !DataSet.

Then, select the Ontology !DataSet on the *Search Tab* and type: glycoprotein % in the text field as show the next figure. The % minds any word as is used in the SQL syntax.

In the [ListTab List Tab] created with the result the desired ontologies have to be checked and saved to the *Result Tab*.

At this point you should select the Human Taxonomy object and add it to a new Search. On the created [SearchTab Search Tab] select the Protein !DataSet.

Then, select the Ontology list and add it to the previously created Search Tab.

Finally, the [ListTab List Tab] shows the human proteins which belong to these two ontologies.
