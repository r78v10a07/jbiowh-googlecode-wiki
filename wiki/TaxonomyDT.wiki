This tool will include the ability to search by *TaxId* and *Synonym* (human, H.sapiens, Homo%) including the use of simple regular expressions too. There is no possibility to use other biological objects as constrains on the *Taxonomy* search tool due to the *Taxonomy* module is the basement of the relational schema and it is used to organize the rest of the inserted data. The search windows will produce a new window, nest figure, with a list of the found taxonomies given the possibility of mouse click on the taxonomy to view its complete description. Also, this window gives the possibility to save in a TSV file format the selected taxonomies or pass it to the result interface for further uses.
