#summary The ProteinProteinGraph class

This class creates a weighted graph with the protein-protein interaction network from a !UniProt accession number using the MIF25 data sources. The MIF25 interaction are used as edges between proteins. The interactionâ€™s weights are created from the numbers of reports in different experiments of the same interaction.  

This class extends the [JBioWHGraph JBioWHGraph] class and override the [http://jbiowh.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/javadoc/jbiowh-persistence/org/jbiowhpersistence/utils/graph/JBioWHGraph.html#populate(org.jbiowh.core.datasets.protein.jpa.entities.Protein,%20int) populate] method for the Protein entity. 

The graph created is a [http://jgrapht.org/javadoc/org/jgrapht/graph/ListenableUndirectedWeightedGraph.html ListenableUndirectedWeightedGraph].
