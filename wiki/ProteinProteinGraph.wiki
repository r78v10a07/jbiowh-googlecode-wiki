#summary The ProteinProteinGraph class

This class creates a weighted graph with the protein-protein interaction network from a !UniProt accession number using the MIF25 data sources. The MIF25 interaction are used as edges between proteins. The interactionâ€™s weights are created from the numbers of reports in different experiments of the same interaction.  

This class extends the [BioWHGraph] class and override the [http://jbiowh.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/javadoc/org/jbiowh/core/utility/graph/BioWHGraph.html#populate(org.jbiowh.core.datasets.protein.jpa.entities.Protein,%20int) populate] method for the Protein entity. 

The graph created is a [http://jgrapht.org/javadoc/org/jgrapht/graph/ListenableUndirectedWeightedGraph.html ListenableUndirectedWeightedGraph].

Also the !ProteinProteinEdge class is used and extends the [http://jgrapht.org/javadoc/org/jgrapht/graph/DefaultWeightedEdge.html DefaultWeightedEdge] class [http://jbiowh.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/javadoc/org/jbiowh/core/datasets/protein/utils/ProteinProteinEdge.html javadoc] and [http://code.google.com/p/jbiowh/source/browse/trunk/src/main/java/org/jbiowh/core/datasets/protein/utils/ProteinProteinEdge.java code]
