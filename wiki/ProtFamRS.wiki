This schema is a relational representation of the !UniRef's XML file. The relational schema storages all information provided by this data source converting the non-relational file to a relational non-redundant schema. 

The main table is the *!UniRefEntry* table. The primary key on this table is the *WID* and it includes, in the field *!DataSet_WID*, the dataset *WID* in the *!DataSet* table as a foreign key. 

The *!UniRefEntry* table links the *Taxonomy* table through the *!TaxId* field. Each *!UniRef* entry is linked to its proteins through the *!UniRefMember* table.
