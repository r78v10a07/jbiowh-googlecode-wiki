#summary This wiki describe the Protein dataset

= Protein = 

The *Protein* data set includes the [http://www.uniprot.org Uniprot] data source, both the *SWISSPROT* and *TREMBL* branch. The next figure shows the relational schema for the Protein dataset.

This schema is a relational representation of the Uniprot's XML file. The relational schema storages all information provided by this data source converting the non-relational file to a relational non-redundant schema. 

The main table is the *Protein* table. The primary key on this table is the *WID* and it includes, in the field *!DataSet_WID*, the dataset *WID* in the *!DataSet* table as a foreign key. 

All the relationships between proteins and other biological objects included on this relational schema are made using the *WID* field of the *Protein* table. A protein object has a relationship with the *Taxonomy* table through the *Protein_has_Taxonomy* and the *Protein_has_TaxonomyHost*. The last table is used on virus's proteins showing the host organism for this virus. These tables are recreated after an update of the Protein dataset or the Taxonomy dataset.   

The relationship with he Ontology dataset is storage on the *Protein_has_Ontology* table giving the possibility to link protein with the ontology terms. This table uses as ontology's primary key the *WID* field on the *Ontology* table. The *Protein_has_Ontology* table is recreated after an update of the Protein dataset or the Ontology dataset. 
  
The relationship with the Gene dataset is storage on the *Protein_has_GeneInfo* table. This table is constructed using the *!ProteinRefSeq* table and the union between the tables created on the gene relational schema. The *Protein_has_GeneInfo* table is recreated after an update of the Protein dataset or the Gene dataset.  This table uses as geneinfo's primary key the *WID* field on the !GeneInfo table.

The protein objects are linked with the drugs too. The first is the *Protein_has_DrugBank* table. This table relates the proteins as drugs targets giving the possibility to obtain for a desired protein the drugs which use this protein as target. There are other tables like *Protein_has_DrugBankAsEnzyme*, *Protein_has_DrugBankAsTransporters* and *Protein_has_DrugBankAsCarriers* which map the relationship between proteins and drugs where the drugs uses the protein as enzyme, as transporter or as carriers. This information is provided by the union between the Uniprot and the !DrugBank data sources. These tables are recreated after an update of the Protein dataset or the !DrugBank dataset.
