#summary This wiki is the introduction to the Java API

= Introduction =

The java *API* is implemented using the [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html Oracle Java SE 7]. The *API* has two principal packages, the *jbiowh.gui* and the *jbiowh.parser*. The first package includes all classes related with the *GUI* interface provided by the [IntroductionDT Desktop tool]. The second package includes the classes to read the data from the data sources (parsers) and to retrieve the data from the database (core). The core package includes the classes to handle the database entities according with the object-oriented model described by the *JPA* approach. Each entity maps the relationship between the biological objects giving total interconnectivity between the objects on the java code. The core classes use the EclipseLink library to map object-oriented models onto MySQL relational database tables in the back-end.

Finally, the java API was designed using the Java Pattern Design concepts (Gamma et al., 1995). Theses concepts standardize the java code by the use of design patterns for external developers involved on object-oriented software design.
