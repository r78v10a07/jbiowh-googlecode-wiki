#summary This wiki describe the Ontology dataset

= Ontology =

The *Ontology* dataset is based in the [http://www.geneontology.org/ GeneOntology] (GO) data source. The next figure shows the relational schema for the *Ontology* dataset. The non-connected tables are temporal tables which are used during the insertion process and remain empties after that.

The *Ontology* table is the main tale on this module. The primary key on this table is the *WID* and it includes, in the field *!DataSet_WID*, the dataset *WID* in the *!DataSet* table as a foreign key. The *GO id*, which has the syntax *!GO:000000* is storage on the *Id* field on this table. The rest of the tables included on this module storage all data provide by *!GeneOntology*. 

The relationship between the ontology objects are build it on using the *WID* identifier in order to have a common integer identifier more easily to use and more efficient to index by the *DBMS* engine.

The *Ontology* search tool included on the *!JBioWH API* will perform the search process over the *GO Id* field and the *Name* field on the main table. Also, the search tool uses the ontology *Synonyms* field on the *!OntologySynonym* table. There is no possibility to use other biological objects as constrains on the *Ontology* search tool due to the *Ontology* module is the basement of the relational schema and it is used to organize the rest of the inserted data.
