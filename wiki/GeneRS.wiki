#summary This wiki describe the Gene dataset 

= Gene = 

The *Gene* dataset is base on the [http:// Entrez Gene] data source. The next figure shows the relational schema for the *Gene* dataset. The non-connected tables handle the additional information provide by the Entrez Gene data source.

The *GeneInfo* table is the main tale on this module. The primary key on this table is the *WID* and it includes, in the field *DataSet_WID*, the dataset *WID* in the *DataSet* table as a foreign key. This table includes the *TaxId* field as a foreign key on the *Taxonomy* table. The schema does not include the *Taxonomy WID* by the *TaxId* due to it is an integer included into the *Gene* original data source and can be used as key without insert more computational effort.

Also, this data source included the *GeneInfo_has_Ontology* table as a *many-to-many* relationship between the genes and the ontology terms. This relational table is modified after the insertion of both, the *Gene* dataset and the *Ontology* dataset. 

The *Gene2Accession* table is the second table on this dataset. It included the *GeneInfo_WID* field as a foreign key of the *GeneInfo* table. Also, the *Gene2Accession* table acts as a link between the *GeneInfo* table and the *Protein* table through the *Gene2Accession_has_Protein* table as a *many-to-many* relationship. This relational table is fitted linking the information provided by the *gene_refseq_uniprotkb_collab* with the *ProteinAccessionNumber* table. This link is constructed from the *Gene* dataset to the *Protein* dataset, other links between genes and proteins are constructed from the *Protein* dataset to the *Gene* dataset. The final table *Protein_has_GeneInfo* is constructed by the union of all relational tables between genes and proteins.  

The next figure shows the temporal tables for the *Gene* dataset. These temporal tables remain empties after the insertion process.

This figure shows two tables *GenomesPTT* and *GenomesPTTTaxonomy*, these tables storage the complete genomes in the *PTT* files included on the *Gene* data source. The *GenomesPTT* table includes the *ProteinGi* id as a foreign key of the *Gene2Accession* table giving the possibility to obtain the relation ship between the *GeneInfo* objects with the *GenomesPTT* objects.
