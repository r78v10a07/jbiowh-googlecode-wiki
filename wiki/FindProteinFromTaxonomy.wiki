= Find Protein from Taxonomy =

The class extends the [AbstractDefaultTool] to parse the command line options.

This Java Main class retrieve the proteome for a Taxonomy or a Taxonomy list. The keyword to by used in the search can be the Tax Id (345201) or a taxonomy synonym (Invertebrate iridescent virus 3). Also, the keyword can include SQL regular expression. The option (-i) with a file name as argument can be used to pass a list of Taxonomies. 

There are two outputs using this main class. If the option (--fasta) is present with a file name as an argument the !UniProt sequences will printed in the file in fasta format. If this option is not present the protein name is printed in the standard output.

The command line options are:

    *   -i set the file with the Taxonomy keywords list (require argument).
    *   -u set the keywords to search (TaxId or Synonym, including SQL regular expression).  
    *   --fasta set the file to write the protein sequence in fasta format (Optional argument).
