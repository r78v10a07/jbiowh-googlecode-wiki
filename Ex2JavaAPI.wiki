#summary This is the Example 2 using the Java API

= Identify all human proteins which are linked to one of the Ontologies in the Ontology List using the  Java API =

Here we are searching for human proteins who are related, at least, to one of the Ontology groups: {{{GO:0009100,GO:0009101}}}  

The Java Code for this example is [http://jbiowh.googlecode.com/svn/jbiowh-tools/src/main/java/org/jbiowhtools/examples/FindALLHumProtinGO.java here]

Go to a CMD Windows console or a linux console to execute the java code:

<code language="bash">
java -cp <path-to the-jbiowhtool-jar-file> org.jbiowhtools.examples.FindALLHumProtinGO -v
</code>

The obtained proteins number is the same that in the others methods.
