Find in a taxonomy family (taxonomy graph) the genes encoding for drug’s target protein that are in the same chromosome at a distance less than a specific number of pair bases. In this example the API is used to create the Taxonomy graph. Then, for each taxonomy into the family a complete exploration is executed over the genes PTT map to identify the genes that are at a distance less than a specific number of pair bases. For these genes the encoded protein is retrieved and used with the !DrugBank database to check if it is a drug target.

The Java Code for this example is [http://jbiowh.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/main/java/org/jbiowh/tools/gene/GenesDrugsFromTaxonomyFamily.java here]

Go to a CMD Windows console or a linux console to execute the java code: 

<code language="bash">
java -cp <path-to the-jbiowh-jar-file> org.jbiowh.tools.gene.GenesDrugsFromTaxonomyFamily -t <Tax Id> -p <window size in pair bases>
</code>
