= Installation guide =
 
Please, check the [SystemRequirements System requirements] before pass to the installation process.

== Downloading the source code =

=== Windows ===
To download the *JBioWH* source code use [http://www.tortoisesvn.net/ TortoiseSVN]. If you are behind a proxy you have to configure the !TortoiseSVN network settings before use it to checkout the *JBioWH* source code.  

Create a folder named _*jbiowh*_, then right click on it and select the Tortoise SVN option _*SVN Checkout...*_. After that, type the *JBioWH* svn project address https://jbiowh.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ and click on _*OK*_. This procedure will download the out-to-date *JBioWH* source code.

=== Linux ===

To download the *JBioWH* source code use the SVN command line. 

<code language="bash">
svn checkout https://jbiowh.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ jbiowh
</code>

== Create tables on the MySQL DBMS ==

Open the _*mysql*_ command line utility. Create the new schema with the command:

<code language="sql">
CREATE DATABASE biowh;
</code>

You can use other name than _*biowh*_, just remember it for further uses and replace the _*biowh*_ world in the above lines by your database name.

Load the relational schema typing the following command:

<code language="sql">
use biowh;
source <path-to-previously-create-jbiowh-folder>/schema/mysql/warehouse.sql;
</code>
  
== Compile the source code ==

Compile the source code to generate a java jar file.

Remember to have in your CLASSPATH the libraries mentioned on the [SystemRequirements System requirements] before compile the source code.

=== Windows ===

You should unzip the [http://jbiowh.googlecode.com/files/JBioWH%20-%20Subversion.zip JBioWH required libraries] in a folder. It could be the _*C:*_ directory. This process will create a folder called _*C:\lib*_ with the libraries inside. 

Use the command line tool in Windows to navigate to the _*jbiowh*_ folder. If you copy the _*jbiowh*_ on _*C:*_ directory you should type on your CMD to compile the *!JBioWH* source code:

{{{
C:
cd jbiowh
ant -lib C:/lib jar
}}}

=== Linux ===

Use the the terminal on Linux to navigate to the _*jbiowh*_ folder. If you save the _*lib*_ and the _*jbiowh*_ folder on your home directory type this to compile the source code: 

Type the following command line: 
<code language="bash">
cd ~/jbiowh
ant -lib ~/lib jar
</code>

After the compilation process you will have a folder named _*dist*_ on the _*jbiowh*_ folder with the generated jar file _*jbiowh.jar*_. Copy the _*jbiowh.jar*_ file to the _*lib*_ directory to have all JAR files together.
